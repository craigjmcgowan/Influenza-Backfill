# ILINet Backfill

This repository contains an analysis of backfill patterns in the CDC's ILINet surveillance system. Backfill occurs when reporting providers send in reports after the initial reporting deadline, causing data to be revised after its initial publication. This backfill can have substantial impacts on the final values of ILINet compared to the initial values.
